My project title - SabriOutlet2
Description about my project is based on e-commerce website for consumers to make their purchases online via web. This is to save the hassle for the consumer to go to a physical stores to make their purchases.
Usage examples - There's 3 parts in total.
1st is the index page which is the main page of my project which shows its content for the website.
2nd is the login page for users to login, currently i've only set to 1 account for testing purposes (userid"sabri" ,pwd"123")
3rd is the registration page where users could input their data to perform registration.
To tally up the registration via database i've used xampp tool to view all the succesful registration.
Tools used - Tomcat v8.0 and xampp for this project.
